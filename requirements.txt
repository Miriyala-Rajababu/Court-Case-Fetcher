Here’s a simple `requirements.txt` file for your **eCourts Case Scraper** project:

```
requests
beautifulsoup4
python-dotenv
sqlite3 ; python_version < '3.11'
```

### Optional (if you use these):

If you plan to add CAPTCHA solving or testing later, you can include:

```
pytesseract     # For OCR if handling CAPTCHA
opencv-python   # For image processing (CAPTCHA)
pytest          # For unit testing
```

So a complete version with optional tools looks like this:

```
requests
beautifulsoup4
python-dotenv
pytesseract
opencv-python
pytest
```

> ✅ Save this as `requirements.txt` in the root directory of your project.
> Let me know if you want me to include only specific libraries you're using.
